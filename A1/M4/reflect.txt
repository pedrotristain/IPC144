Assignment:			1
Milestone:			4

1. Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.

Having a structure Contact that is supposed to hold all the info or data a contact has in the program looks more organic and is easier for a human to read it.
Every data from a contact is stored together in one single object, making it easier to access and manipulate the data from that particular contact.

2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?

Figuring out the difference between compilers and the respective behaviors that each of them have.
For instance, Visual Studio will accept struct Contact contact = { 0 }; as a way to initialize the structure with all the members holding a 0 or empty string value.
GCC, on Matrix, will not accept that.

3. How long did it take you to complete Milestone 4?

It took me a few minutes to assemble the code, moving the pieces of code that were already done into functions and declaring the prototypes.
But figuring out the bugs, syntax differences (like changing the dot operand to the arrow when using a pointer for a construct in a function) and difference in behavior between compilers tooke me a few hours.
It took me around 4 hours to get everything working properly.
