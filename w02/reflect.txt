Section: Q

1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?
Learning about different ways to achieve the same result, like using castings and modulus in place of other arithmetic calculations.

2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?
Because C standard compilers truncate the number down when you multiply them by 100 and cast it as an integer.

3- What is the result of a casting operation?
The result is that the value that is being casted as another type will be transformed to the new type.

4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?
To learn about different ways of getting the same result. Also, by practicing using different operators, we better understand how they work and get used to using them when coding.
