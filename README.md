# IPC144

Workshops and assignments I completed during my first semester (Fall 2018) @ Seneca ICT College.

IPC 144 covered the fundaments of computer programming, introducing structured programming techniques, problem solving strategies and logic skills, using C language.

It also intended to train the students in better programming techniques, by requiring good code identation and documentation.
