1) In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?
Because arrays in C need to be declared with a defined size.
If the size is 8, in this workshop, and the user inputed a 9 or 10 when he is asked for it, the array would not have enough memory space to hold all the values.

2) In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?
The advantages of using arrays is that they are faster to process, since the values are stored in memory continually.
They are also good to store parallel data, in a table manner.
The downsize of using arrays is that they are inflexible, containing only 1 type of data and can occupy more space in memory than needed.

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why?
It was just right.
We had to code something we did before, which made it easier, but using new elements, such as array, and a dinamic range of days made the logic behind it harder.
