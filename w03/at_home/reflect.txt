1) The three iteration constructs are FOR, WHILE and DO WHILE.

2) A DO WHILE loop will execute the code sequence at least once and keep executing it as long as the determined conditions apply. 
A WHILE loop will only execute the code sequence if the conditinos are met.
The DO WHILE iteration has it's condition declared in the end of the executable code block, where the WHILE's conditions are declared at the beginning. 

3) CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION is a selection construct that simplifies the optional path construct, also known in C as IF.
This selection construct has a condition and two sub-expressions that are evaluated depending according to the result of the condition.
If the condition turns out to be true, the first sub-expression operand is evaluated, otherwise the second one is evaluated instead.
