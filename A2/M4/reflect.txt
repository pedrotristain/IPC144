Assignment:         2
Milestone:          4

1. Briefly explain how the two functions findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone benefit your source code with respect to overall maintenance and readability.

Both functions serve contain code that is reused by other functions multiple times.
By having these two functions, the code becomes organized, easier to read and simpler to change if the need arise.

2. What did you learn most from doing Assignment 2?

I learned how an organized code, with functions and data structures properly defined make it easier to program.
When I got to Milestone 4, on Assignment 2, I was expecting to have a lot of work due to the increase in functionality of the program.
I was surprised that, by having gone through Milestone 1 to 3, my workload on Milestone 4 was greatly reduced, even if the final code source had way more lines than any assignment we had so far.

I also learned (through this course, not only Assignment 2) about the importance of commenting my code.
I did not had the habit of commenting my code, and it always backfired on me.
This is basically the first project where I comment almost every line of code.
It was really easy to understand what was happening even if I reviewed a code weeks after I had wrote it.
