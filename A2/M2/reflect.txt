1. In 3 or 4 sentences explain the term “function” and briefly discuss the need for functions in any
language?

- Function is a smaller part of the code of a program that is separated from the main program's code.
- It needs to be directly called by the main program's code.
- On being called, a function can either receive parameters or not, depending on the function's declaration.
- It can also return a value, or not, depending on the function's declaration.

Functions are useful for any language because they help to organize the code and divide it in smaller parts.
It improves human readability, as it is easier to look for a piece of code in smaller.
Functions also help with the program coding as functions are can be reused multiple times.
Lastly, changing a code in a function is easier than having to change every instance of the same code in multiple places.

2. Briefly explain why you think the "helper" functions are in a different module and why those
functions were not included in the "contacts" module?

The helper module is separated from the contacts module because it deals with different aspects of the program.

The contacts module deals directly with receiving data from the user and storing it into the contact structures and its members.
The helper module deals with the interface, the flow of the program and other controls of the program, such as flushing the buffer and evaluating data.

Since both modules deal with different aspects of the program, it is good practice to keep their functions separated from each other.
Keeping modules separated from each other helps with readability and with the organization of the code.
