By completing this workshop I learned about how the printf() function outputs the literal string inside it to the user.
It also doesn't know when to break lines and start a new one, so the escape sequence \n has to be used.
Finally, I learned how to submit the assignment through matrix and how to fix whatever I did wrong when it returns a error message.
